This subject is typically a single creature, item, or small location (such as a room or corridor), but the GM might allow a different scope for your investigation. You don't need to know the identity, purpose, or nature of the subject, but you do need to be aware of its existence. For instance, finding a footprint is enough to investigate the creature that left it, and seeing a hasty sketch of an item or location can be enough to start your investigation of that subject.  Whenever you attempt a Perception or skill check to investigate a designated subject, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check. The exact checks this applies to depend on the actions you use to investigate and are determined by the GM, but checks to investigate are typically Perception checks or skill checks that use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.  You can maintain two active investigations at a time. If you Pursue another Lead after that, the subject must be different from any of your current investigations (or rather, they must be different as far as you know), and you give up on a current subject of your choice. Once you've given up pursuit of a subject, you can't Pursue that Lead again until after the next time you make your daily preparations.   Advanced Player's Guide pg. 56  once per 10 minutes  Another creature attempts a check to investigate a lead you're pursuing. You share information with the triggering creature. They gain a circumstance bonus to their check equal to your circumstance bonus to checks investigating your subject from Pursue a Lead. The GM can add any relevant traits to this reaction depending on the situation, such as  auditory  and  linguistic  if you're conveying information verbally.  You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the investigator archetype.",

Your social identity is an upstanding member of society, while your vigilante identity is a skilled and cunning warrior. Neither of these identities is a false front; you really are both of these people, and as such, your two identities can be at most one alignment step from each other (for instance, you could be neutral in one identity and neutral evil in the other, but not chaotic evil in the other). If someone attempts to discern your other identity, they must use a  Seek  action to attempt a Perception check against your  Deception  DC, as if you were using the  Impersonate  action. Your Deception DC against such attempts is 20 + your proficiency modifier instead of the normal DC. Unlike with Impersonate, you don't have to attempt a Deception check to interact with someone to conceal your other identity\u2014a check happens only if someone else specifically tries to uncover your other identity.  Changing from one identity to the other takes 1 minute and must be done out of sight from other creatures. As this process involves both physical changes such as clothing and makeup along with an altered state of mind, other effects that change your appearance don't reduce the time required to change identities.  Your two identities are completely distinct. You have your current identity's alignment for effects that rely on alignment, though you are eligible for abilities that require a certain alignment (such as a cleric's deity) only if both of your identities qualify. Checks to  Recall Knowledge  about one of your identities don't reveal information about the other unless the person attempting the check knows both identities are the same person. Effects that detect you based on your identity, such as the  detect alignment  spell, work only if you are currently in the identity the effect is trying to detect; otherwise, the effect fails as if the target didn't exist.  To maintain the separation between your identities, some of your abilities have one of two traits:  social  or  vigilante . You can use social feats only while in your social identity. Your class feats and vigilante feats are associated with your vigilante identity, and using them while in your social identity risks exposing you as a vigilante. This means that if you were particularly meek or inconspicuous before you took this feat, your identity could be at greater risk of exposure. If your identity is exposed to the public, you lose the benefits of Vigilante Dedication to disguising yourself, but you can otherwise use both social and vigilante abilities in either identity unless they rely on your identity being a secret. You can use feats that don't have either trait regardless of your current identity.  You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the vigilante archetype.",

You Cast a Spell that takes 1 or 2 actions to cast and requires a spell attack roll. The effects of the spell don't occur immediately but are imbued into your attack instead. Make a melee Strike with a weapon or unarmed attack. Your spell is coupled with your attack, using your attack roll result to determine the effects of both the Strike and the spell.

After you use Spellstrike, you can't do so again until you recharge your Spellstrike as a single action, which has the  concentrate  trait.

Nature allows you to contact the spirits of nature that form  leshies , who are born of pure life essence rather than spiritual energy and can answer questions about natural features like the location of nearby water or plant life. Religion reveals the presence of  angelic ,  demonic , or other spirits in service to divine beings, who provide information about sources of powerful positive or negative energy, sacred or profane influences, or the presence of undead. Occultism allows you to contact lingering spirits, psychic echoes of the departed dead, and spirits from beyond reality, who tell you about things like strange auras, effects, or the presence of unnatural occult beings.  Spend 10 minutes and attempt a check to  Recall Knowledge  with the chosen skill; the DC is determined by the GM (usually a very high DC for the level of the highest-level creature you might encounter in the area). If you're legendary in the chosen skill, you can use this feat once per hour, instead of only once per day, but you can't use it again on any area that overlaps a previous area.  You can select this feat multiple times, each time picking a different skill in which you have the master proficiency rank. You can use this feat with each skill once per day (or once per hour, if you're legendary).  The spirits reveal themselves to you and have a  helpful  attitude toward you. Only you can perceive these spirits. They answer three simple questions about the environment within 100 feet of you, depending on the skill you chose and thus the type of spirits you contact. Their answers are almost always a single word, and their knowledge is limited to within their area of interest.  As with a critical success, but the spirits are  indifferent  to you and answer only one question.  You are unable to contact the spirits of this place.  You contact one or more malevolent spirits.

You use Spellstrike, making a melee Strike against each enemy within your reach instead of against one enemy.

If you Strike more foes than the spell could target, choose which foes are affected by the spell. Each attack counts toward your multiple attack penalty but doesn't increase your penalty until you've made all your attacks.  If you use  Expansive Spellstrike  to Spellstrike with an area spell, apply the area as described in Expansive Spellstrike, choosing one of the creatures you Strike to determine the area and whether the spell fails due to a critically failed Strike. If you use Expansive Spellstrike to Spellstrike with a targeted spell, each creature you critically fail to Strike is unaffected by the spell, but the spell isn't lost completely from a single critical failure. You can use this activity with only melee Strikes, even if you have the  starlit span  hybrid study or a similar ability.",

By performing a rite that takes 1 day, you create an animated object from a hut, small house, covered wagon, tent, or similar construction of up to Huge size.  The hut uses your AC, saving throw modifiers, and Perception modifier and has 150 HP and Hardness 10. It has the construct armor ability, meaning once it's reduced to less than half its Hit Points, or immediately upon being damaged by a critical hit, its AC is reduced by 4 until it is repaired.  The hut can't attack or attempt skill checks. You can give the hut a command as a single action, which has the  auditory  and  concentrate  traits; after 1 round of reconfiguring itself, the hut then follows that command until you give it a different command.  Guard The hut watches for trespassers within 120 feet using your Perception modifier and screams if it spots any. Lock Each entrance to the hut is sealed with a lock spell. Move The hut gains a Speed of 60 feet, growing giant bird or bone legs, if necessary, and follows an extremely basic movement command you give it, such as \u201cfollow me\u201d or \u201cmove that direction.\u201d While perfectly suitable for overland travel, the hut's broad movements and 1-round delay on response time are too imprecise to predictably direct in a combat encounter or other situation where seconds and precise locations count. Hide The hut appears to be a normal, mundane object of its type. This is a 10th-level illusion effect.  You can have only one hut at a time. If you animate a new hut, your previous hut immediately reverts to its original, mundane form. If you die, the hut continues following the last order you gave it indefinitely.",
